Not just any subatomic particle can be used as a qubit in quantum computers. A robust quantum system needs to be protected from unnecessary interactions. One candidate for such a system are localized Yu-Shiba-Rusinov (YSR) states, which can exist within the energy gap of conventional superconductors. Delocalized Yu-Shiba-Rusinov states, however, may offer new ways to remotely couple magnetic systems.

Everyone knows that “Diamonds are forever”. The brilliantly shining stones make for magnificent jewelry and represent carbon in its most prestigious form. What most people do not know however is the fascinating physics that can take place within this material.

Prof. Gufei Zhang (NanoSYD, Mads Clausen Institute, University of Southern Denmark) and his collaborators have been working with diamond thin films for several years now. 

Diamond films are grown on silicon substrates. Films that are grown on silicon are especially interesting for applications since they are directly compatible with today’s silicon based devices.

During the growth of the diamond films, small amounts of boron are mixed in with the diamond. The amount of boron changes the colour and electrical properties of the diamond.

Diamond in its purest form is an electrical insulator, unable to carry any current. Increasing the amount of boron changes its colour from clear to light blue, and the insulator into a semiconductor. Adding more boron will turn the diamond film brightly blue, making it metallic. When even more boron is added the film turns pitch black.

### Ferromagnetism and superconductivity – two mutually antagonistic states (?)

Prof. Zhang and his collaborators have found [previously](https://pubs.acs.org/doi/abs/10.1021/acsnano.7b01688) that such black diamond films are on the one hand ferromagnetic, similar to the well known magnets iron, nickel and cobalt. On the other hand, when cooling these thin diamond films to very low temperatures, they even become superconducting.

Superconductivity is a state of matter in which a material can transport current without losses across a very large distance. Furthermore, superconductors are perfect diamagnets. This means that they expel all magnetic fields. This is a phenomenon that is taken advantage of with the MagLev trains, where trains containing superconducting ceramics are floating above magnetic tracks. How this works, is shown for example [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EbORQVttbeU).

Ferromagnetism and superconductivity are not usually found in the same material. Those few materials that do show both effects are therefore even more interesting to study.

Recently, Prof. Zhang and his collaborators found long Yu-Shiba-Rusinov bands inside their thin diamond films, which no one had observed before. To explain what Yu-Shiba-Rusinov bands are and why this is a great discovery, we need to take a look at the term “density of states” that is widely used in solid state physics:

### The density of states

Electrons inside a solid body can move with different speeds. Instead of talking about the speed of the electrons, scientists usually prefer to talk about the energy the electron has. And how many electrons in a material can have a certain energy at a certain temperature is called the “density of states”. 

Electrons do always want to minimize their energy. So naturally they would all want to have the lowest energy possible. However, electrons do also want to be unique. So if two electrons were to have the same energy, they would need to distinguish each other in another way. Since electrons are very small particles, they only have a few properties in which they can differ from each other. So many of the electrons have to have a higher energy. 

At the lowest temperature possible, the electrons fill up all the energies up to a value we call the chemical potential. 

When the temperature increases some of the electrons gain energy and can have energies that are higher than the chemical potential.
For a metal there are energies available just above the chemical potential for the electrons to have. This is why a current can flow easily in a metal when a Voltage is applied. 

In an insulator however, the energies just above the chemical potential are forbidden. Above those forbidden energies, there are however more allowed energies. They are just not so easy to reach. When the temperature gets high enough, some electrons can gain enough energy to have an energy above this energy “gap” as it is. This is why when you heat up an insulator high enough it may eventually carry current. 

The density of states of superconductors is special. 

When superconductors are cooled below their “transition temperature” the electrons inside the superconductor start behaving very strangely. They start forming “Cooper pairs”. (If Cooper pairs made you think of Sheldon Cooper: Yes, he was named for Leon Cooper, who was one of the three scientists, the other two being John Bardeen and Robert Schrieffer, who received the Nobel Prize for their theoretical description of superconductivity, the B(ardeen)C(ooper)S(chrieffer) Theory.)

After pairing up nicely, the electrons do not really care anymore about being unique, and they all give up some of their energy to have as small an energy as possible.
So there are now a large amount of energies that the electrons do not want to take up while they are nicely paired up. 

And this leads to a big “gap” in the “density of states”. 

### Yu-Shiba Rusinov bands

In very special materials,  a few energies in this gap are available. So next to all those electrons that exist in nice Cooper Pairs, we can have a few single electrons that have these very unique energies inside the gaps. We call them Yu-Shiba-Rusinov states. These states were independently predicted by three different scientists: L. Yu, H. Shiba, and A. I. Rusinov, at the end of the 1960’s, and have only recently been confirmed experimentally. 

These energies are rather special, they are usually very localized and are protected by the gap around them, which is what makes them appealing for qubits. 

Qubits are the quantum computer analogon of the bits used for computing in today’s computers. 

Quantum computers will be able to perform calculations that are impossible on today’s computers. And with that they will solve many technological problems, starting with calculating the most efficient batteries and helping to untangle the complicated structures of our DNA.

And while quantum computers may not replace the computers we have in our homes, any time soon, they are going to help deepen our understanding of the world around us.

Prof. Zhang and his collaborators discovered delocalized YSR states within the superconducting gap of diamond thin films that extend over several tens of nanometers forming YSR bands. This spread of the YSR states has never been observed before, and opens the route towards new devices in which magnetic systems can be remotely coupled.
