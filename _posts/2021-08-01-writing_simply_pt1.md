I have recently tried to describe the instrument I work at using the 1000 most common words in the English language (using this [editor](https://splasho.com/upgoer5/)) and I learned the following things:
Explaining something complicated using simple words is difficult but rewarding.
Sometimes a slightly more difficult word will make an explanation significantly easier. So it is important to find a balance 😀
 
So this week I will share the text using the 1000 most common words only and next week I will share the text using a few words that are not on the list, such as magnetic, atom.. I am curious which one you think is more understandable. 

RESEDA is a big thing which can see how the tiny things inside matter move. To do this, “RESEDA” uses other very tiny things that can have a direction.
The very tiny things with direction are picked by how fast they move. This is the same as picking them by color. One good thing of “RESEDA” is that the very tiny things don’t need to be exactly the same color. The very tiny things moving towards “RESEDA” have all the colors, so this way we can use more very tiny things at once. So, “RESEDA” does not take as long to see how the tiny things in stuff move than some other big things. A lot of big things can not use as many tiny things to see how the very tiny things move, because for that they need one very clear color.

At “RESEDA” the very tiny things move from the box that picks them by how fast they go, to a box that picks them by their direction. Because at “RESEDA” we want the very tiny things to have a well picked direction. We then use round things all along “RESEDA” so the very tiny things do not get lost while flying through “RESEDA”.
After the box that picks the very tiny things by their direction, they reach a box that flips their direction by a corner. The very tiny things can be flipped fast or slow.
The very tiny things are then allowed to fly for a bit before they reach another box that flips their direction by a corner. At this box they are flipped faster than at the first box.

After this, the very tiny things fly through a few more round things so they do not get lost.
Then they reach the box that checks their direction. This box changes the direction of the very tiny things into a change of light and dark.
(Light means many very tiny things, dark means few very tiny things.) Then the very tiny things fly through the stuff we want to study.
There some of the very tiny things will hit the tiny things in the stuff and they will change how fast they go. If the very tiny things change how fast they go, they will reach the picture taking box faster or slower than the other very tiny things.

At “RESEDA” this means we will not see these very tiny things in our picture. Because the picture is taken at a very clear time. This means the picture will be less bright than we expected.
